In a new [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/pen) complete the following program so that the `min()` function returns the minimum of its two received numbers (Let’s pretend the JavaScript Math.min() function doesn’t exist).

```
// TODO: write the min() function here

console.log(min(4.5, 5)); // Must show 4.5
console.log(min(19, 9)); // Must show 9
console.log(min(1, 1)); // Must show 1
```

Sample output:

```
4.5
9
1
```
