In a new [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/pen)Â write a program that asks the user for a month number (between 1 and 12), then uses either a "switch" or an "if" statement (you choose) to show an alert window with the number of days of that month. Leap years are excluded. Incorrect inputs must be taken into account by displaying "Unknown month."

Sample input:

```
12
```

Sample output:

```
"This month has 31 days"
```
