**Objective:**
In this assignment, you'll practice using `for...of` loops to iterate over arrays and `for` loops to iterate over strings.

**Instructions:**

1. Create a new project on [codepen.io](https://codepen.io) called **"Loop through Strings."**

2. Write a program that:

  - Creates an array of strings containing five words of your choice. For example: 

```
const words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"];
```

  - Uses a `for...of` loop to iterate through the array of words.
  - For each word in the array, use a nested `for` loop to iterate through the characters of the word.
  - Print each character of the word on a new line. After printing the characters of one word, print an empty line before moving to the next word in the array.

3. **Sample Output:**

```
a
p
p
l
e

b
a
n
a
n
a

c
h
e
r
r
y

d
a
t
e

e
l
d
e
r
b
e
r
r
y
```

4. **Then:**

  - After printing each word, count the number of characters in the word and display the word and its length at the end.
  - Example output: 

```
The word apple has 5 characters.
```

**Important Notes:**

- The `for...of` loop is used for the outer loop to access each word in the array directly.
- The inner `for` loop is used to iterate over each character of the word.

**Submission:**

- Save your CodePen project and submit the link.
