# Assignment: Ch. 9 - Now back to our RPG (In class assignment)

## Description

In a new codepen.io named RPG v.1 and using the code sample from chapter 9 in our book ([The JS Way](https://thejsway.net/chapter09/index.html#object-oriented-programming)) you will create a character class that can be used to add characters and monsters to our RPG. Having both characters and monsters in our game will allow for battles.

The rules of engagement are as follows:

## Objective
## Instructions

- If attacked, a character sees their life points decrease from the strength of the attacker.
- If its health value falls below zero, the character is considered dead and cannot attack anymore.
- Its vanquisher receives a fixed number of 10 experience points for its victory.

**Sample output:**

```
Welcome to the adventure! Here are our heroes:
Aurora has 150 health points, 25 as strength and 0 XP points
Glacius has 130 health points, 30 as strength and 0 XP points
A wild monster has appeared: it's named Spike
Spike attacks Aurora and causes 20 damage points
Aurora has 130 health points left
Spike attacks Glacius and causes 20 damage points
Glacius has 110 health points left
Aurora attacks Spike and causes 25 damage points
Spike has 15 health points left
