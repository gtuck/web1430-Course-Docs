In a new [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/pen/) named "CtoF," write a javascript program that asks the user for a temperature in Celsius and then converts and displays it in Fahrenheit.

```
The conversion between scales is calculated by the formula: [°F] = [°C] x 9/5 + 32.
```

Submit the URL to your CtoF **codepen.io**
