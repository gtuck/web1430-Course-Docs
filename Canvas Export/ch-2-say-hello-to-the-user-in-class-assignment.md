In a new codepen.io named "SayHello," write a program asking users for their first and last names as separate inputs. The program then displays them in one sentence.

```
// Say hello to the user
// TODO: Input - ask the user for their first name
// TODO: Input - ask the user for their last name
// TODO: Output - combine the names using a template literal and display the result in the console
```

Submit the URL to your **codepen.io** as covered in class.
