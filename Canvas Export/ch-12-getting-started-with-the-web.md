#### **Assignment Instructions**

Follow the steps below to complete your assignment. Take your time and consider each decision carefully to create a cohesive design for your website.

- Brainstorm Your Website Concept 

  - Decide what your website will be about. It could be anything you are interested in, such as a hobby, a place you love, or a favorite game. Write down your idea.
  - Answer the following questions: 

    - What is the purpose of your website? (e.g., informational, personal blog, entertaining)
    - What information will you present? Write a title and a paragraph describing your website's main content.

- Visual Style Choices 

  - Decide on the overall look and feel of your website: 

    - Choose a background color that fits your theme. Use a color picker tool (e.g., [MDN Color Picker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_colors/Color_picker_tool)) to select a color and note its hex code (e.g., #660066).
    - Choose a font style that matches the tone of your site (e.g., formal, casual, cartoony). Explore options on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) and write down your font name.

- Sketch Your Website Layout 

  - Grab a pen and paper and sketch a rough layout of your website. Include the following elements: 

    - A heading (your website's H1 title).
    - An image that represents your topic.
    - A paragraph of text describing your topic.

  - Remember, this doesn't need to be a perfect drawing—just a rough sketch to visualize the structure and layout of your webpage.

- Select Your Assets 

  - Image: Find an image that matches your website's theme. Search for a Creative Commons-licensed image using [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) Images or another copyright-friendly source. Either save the image or copy its web address.
  - Color: Make sure you have saved the hex code of your chosen background color.
  - Font: Note the name and source of the font you plan to use.

#### **Submission Requirements**

- A written summary of your website concept, including the answers to the questions above.
- A photo or scan of your sketched website layout.
- A list of your chosen assets, including: 

  - The image source (either the file or its URL).
  - The hex code of your background color.
  - The name and source of your chosen font.

This assignment is the foundation for your first webpage. Take your time and be creative—this will set the stage for future lessons!
