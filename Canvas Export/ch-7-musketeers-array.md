In a new codepen.io, write a program that creates an `array` named Musketeers containing values "Athos", "Porthos" and "Aramis."

- Shows each array element using a `for` loop.
- Adds the "D'Artagnan" value to the array.
- Shows each array element using the `forEach()` method.
- Remove poor "Aramis".
- Shows each array element using a `for-of` loop.

Sample output:

```
"Here are the three musketeers:"
"Athos"
"Porthos"
"Aramis"

"Now there are four of them:"
"Athos"
"Porthos"
"Aramis"
"D'Artagnan"

"Poor Aramis has died!"
"Athos"
"Porthos"
"D'Artagnan"
```
