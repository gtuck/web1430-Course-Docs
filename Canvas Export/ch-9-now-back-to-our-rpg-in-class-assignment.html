<title>Assignment: Ch. 9 - Now back to our RPG (In class assignment)</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>In a new codepen.io named RPG v.1 and using the code sample from chapter 9 in our book (<a class="instructure_file_link inline_disabled" href="https://thejsway.net/chapter09/index.html#object-oriented-programming" target="_blank">The JS Way</a>) you will create a character class that can be used to add characters and monsters to our RPG. Having both characters and monsters in our game will allow for battles.</p>
<p>The rules of engagement are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If attacked, a character sees their life points decrease from the strength of the attacker.</li>
<li>If its health value falls below zero, the character is considered dead and cannot attack anymore.</li>
<li>Its vanquisher receives a fixed number of 10 experience points for its victory.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sample output:</strong></p>
<pre>Welcome to the adventure! Here are our heroes:
Aurora has 150 health points, 25 as strength and 0 XP points
Glacius has 130 health points, 30 as strength and 0 XP points
A wild monster has appeared: it's named Spike

Spike attacks Glacius and causes 20 damage points
Glacius has 110 health points left
