let number1 = 5;
let number2 = 3;

// TODO: enter your code below this line (and nowhere else!)

console.log(number1); // Should show 3
console.log(number2); // Should show 5
```

In a new [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/pen/) named VarSwap, write a program with the code above. Add the necessary code to swap the values of variables number1 and number2.
