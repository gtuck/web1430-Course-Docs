In a new [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/pen) write a program containing two functions `circumference()` and `area()` to calculate the circumference and area of a circle defined by its radius (circumference and area calculation formulas can be found via Google search). When the program runs prompt the user to "Enter the circle radius:" and then use the value as the basis of your calculations.

Hint: The value of the number π (Pi) is obtained with `Math.PI` in JavaScript.

```
// TODO: write the circumference() function here

// TODO: write the area() function here

// TODO: Prompt the user here

// TODO: Generate the output here
```

Sample output:

```
The radius is: 1
Its circumference is 6.283185307179586
Its area is 3.141592653589793
```
