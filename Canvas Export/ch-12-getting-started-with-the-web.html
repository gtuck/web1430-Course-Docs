<body>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> In this assignment, you will plan and design a simple website using the guidelines provided. You will decide on the content, choose visual elements, sketch your layout, and select assets for your webpage. This assignment will prepare you for future steps. Use (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/What_will_your_website_look_like">MDN What will your website look like?</a>) as an additional resource.</p>
<h4><strong>Assignment Instructions</strong></h4>
<p>Follow the steps below to complete your assignment. Take your time and consider each decision carefully to create a cohesive design for your website.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Brainstorm Your Website Concept
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Decide what your website will be about. It could be anything you are interested in, such as a hobby, a place you love, or a favorite game. Write down your idea.</li>
<li>Answer the following questions:
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>What is the purpose of your website? (e.g., informational, personal blog, entertaining)</li>
<li>What information will you present? Write a title and a paragraph describing your website's main content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Visual Style Choices
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Decide on the overall look and feel of your website:
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Choose a background color that fits your theme. Use a color picker tool (e.g., <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_colors/Color_picker_tool" target="_blank">MDN Color Picker</a>) to select a color and note its hex code (e.g., #660066).</li>
<li>Choose a font style that matches the tone of your site (e.g., formal, casual, cartoony). Explore options on <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://fonts.google.com" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a> and write down your font name.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sketch Your Website Layout
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Grab a pen and paper and sketch a rough layout of your website. Include the following elements:
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>A heading (your website's H1 title).</li>
<li>An image that represents your topic.</li>
<li>A paragraph of text describing your topic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remember, this doesn't need to be a perfect drawing—just a rough sketch to visualize the structure and layout of your webpage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select Your Assets
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Image: Find an image that matches your website's theme. Search for a Creative Commons-licensed image using <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://unsplash.com" target="_blank">Unsplash</a> Images or another copyright-friendly source. Either save the image or copy its web address.</li>
<li>Color: Make sure you have saved the hex code of your chosen background color.</li>
<li>Font: Note the name and source of the font you plan to use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Submission Requirements</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A written summary of your website concept, including the answers to the questions above.</li>
<li>A photo or scan of your sketched website layout.</li>
<li>A list of your chosen assets, including:
<ul>
<li>The image source (either the file or its URL).</li>
<li>The hex code of your background color.</li>
<li>The name and source of your chosen font.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This assignment is the foundation for your first webpage. Take your time and be creative—this will set the stage for future lessons!</p>
