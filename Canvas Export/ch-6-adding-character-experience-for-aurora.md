Create a new [codepen.io](http://codepen.io) named 'Aurora XP' that improves our in-class assignment Aurora character by adding an 'experience' property named 'xp.' Its initial value is 0. Experience must appear in the character description.

```
// TODO: create the character object here

// Aurora is harmed by an arrow
aurora.health -= 20;

// Aurora equips a strength necklace
aurora.strength += 10;

// Aurora learn a new skill
aurora.xp += 15;

console.log(aurora.describe());
```

Sample output

```
"Aurora has 130 health points, 35 as strength and 15 XP points"
```
