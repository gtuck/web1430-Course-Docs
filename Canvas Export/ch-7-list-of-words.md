In a new codepen.io named 'List of words' write a program that repeatedly prompts the user for a word until the user types "stop". The program then shows each of these words, except "stop".

```
// TODO: Create the words array

// TODO: Create the word variable

// TODO: While the word is not stop

// TODO: Loop through words array and generate output
```

Sample output:

```
"You have entered the following words:"
"Thanos"
"was"
"just"
"the"
"Beginning"
```
