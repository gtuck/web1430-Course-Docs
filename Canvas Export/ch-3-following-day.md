In a new [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/pen)Â write a program that asks the user for any day of the week (ex. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday), then uses a "switch" to calculate and show the name of the following day. Incorrect inputs (anything other than an actual day) must be taken into account and output "Unrecognized day name".

Sample input:

```
Monday
```

Sample output:

```
"Tomorrow is Tuesday"
```
