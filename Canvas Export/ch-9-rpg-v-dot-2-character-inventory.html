<title>Assignment: Ch. 9 - RPG v.2 - Character inventory</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>In a new codepen.io, create RPG v.2 to improve the example RPG v.1 we created in class to add character inventory management according to the following rules:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>A character's inventory is an object literal that contains some gold and keys as properties (see ch. 6).</li>
<li>Each character begins with ten gold and one key.</li>
<li>The character description must show the inventory state.</li>
<li>When a character slays another character, the victim's inventory is transferred to its vanquisher's inventory.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sample output:</strong></p>
