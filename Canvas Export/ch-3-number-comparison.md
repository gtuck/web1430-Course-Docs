In a new [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/pen)Â write a program that asks the user for two numbers (num1 & num2) then uses an `if, else if, else` conditional statement to compare the values and displays weather the first number is less than, greater than or equal to the second number.

Sample input -> Output:

```
8 & 9 -> "8 is less than 9"
9 & 2 -> "9 is greater than 2"
6 & 6 -> "6 and 6 are equal"
```
