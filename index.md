#### Instructor Philosophy
This course emphasizes learning-by-doing, rapid feedback, and incremental skill growth. Mistakes are treated as data. Consistent practice matters more than cramming.

#### Course Description
Introduces JavaScript client-side programming: syntax, values, control flow, objects, arrays, functions (including higher-order functions), basic OOP patterns, DOM traversal/manipulation, events, and introductory AJAX/fetch.

#### Course Relevance
JavaScript underpins modern web development. Skills here prepare you for frameworks, backend JS (Node.js), and UI engineering practices.

#### Learning Outcomes / Objectives
By the end of the course, you should be able to:
1. Use a professional text editor effectively (VS Code or CodePen alternatives).
2. Declare, assign, and transform variables of primitive and reference types.
3. Apply Boolean logic and comparison operations to control program flow.
4. Create and manipulate objects, arrays, and nested data structures.
5. Use operators, conditionals, and loops (for/while) appropriately.
6. Write and invoke functions (declarations, expressions, arrow), including higher-order patterns (callbacks, array iteration methods).
7. Explain value vs reference semantics and manage object mutation.
8. Traverse and manipulate the DOM (query, create, insert, remove nodes).
9. Handle user interaction via events (bubbling, default prevention).
10. Perform basic form handling and validation in the browser.
11. Use incremental problem-solving, debugging (console / devtools), and code readability practices (naming, formatting).
12. Practice academic integrity and professional collaboration norms.

#### Required / Free Learning Resources
- **Primary Text:** [The JavaScript Way](https://thejsway.net/)
- MDN Guides: [JavaScript First Steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps)
- Tooling: [CodePen](https://codepen.io), modern browser (Chrome/Firefox), VS Code (recommended)

#### Technology Requirements
- Reliable computer capable of running a modern browser and Zoom simultaneously.
- Stable internet (min ~5 Mbps).
- Microphone (required), camera (recommended).
- Ability to share screen for code troubleshooting.

#### Recommended Study Strategies
- Daily: 20–30 minutes of coding practice (reinforces syntax retention).
- After each assignment: Write a short reflection of one concept learned.
- Use console.log strategically, then replace with clearer debugging (breakpoints).
- Re-implement small exercises from memory 1–2 days later (spaced repetition).
- Form a study group (2–3 peers) for code reviews (no copying).

#### Communication (Outside of Class)
Schedule visits using [Google Calendar link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ2ZxOHd88y9dR5ZmI1YgcfcnhVGj2lfXlknmyVUPbRtVoTjHj3OJbIADiaxM2RC9pGFkeTWF6CK?gv=true) or email anytime (24–36 hr response on weekdays).

#### Attendance
Synchronous attendance expected. More than X (set number) unexcused absences may reduce the participation portion of your grade. Notify instructor in advance for legitimate conflicts. You are responsible for missed material.

#### Participation
Active engagement (asking/answering questions, code walkthroughs, respectful peer feedback). Passive presence (logged in but unresponsive) may not earn full credit.

#### Use of Generative AI Tools
Unless explicitly permitted for a specific assignment, using AI code/text generation (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot) to produce solutions you submit is considered unauthorized assistance. When permitted, you must:
- Document the tool, prompt(s), and resulting edits.
- Verify and understand all generated code.
Violations fall under Academic Integrity.

#### Assignments & Late Work
- Submission via Canvas unless stated otherwise.
- Late penalty: 10% of possible points per calendar day late (minimum grade 0%). After N days (define, e.g., 5) no submissions accepted unless prior arrangement.
- Technical issues are not accepted as justification without documented effort to resolve.

#### Grading (Proposed Structure — adjust as finalized)
- In-Class Practice / Participation: 10%
- Weekly Chapter Exercises: 35%
- Projects / Applied Labs: 25%
- Quizzes (Including Syllabus Quiz): 10%
- Final Practical / Cumulative Exercise: 15%
- Professionalism / Attendance: 5%
(Replace or adjust weights; ensure total = 100%)

A = 93–100, A- = 90–92, B+ = 87–89, B = 83–86, B- = 80–82, C+ = 77–79, C = 73–76, C- = 70–72, D+ = 67–69, D = 60–66, E < 60 (modify if department scale differs).

#### Feedback & Return Time
Typical turnaround: small exercises 3–4 days; larger projects 7–10 days.

#### Extra Credit
Not offered. Focus on required work.

### Campus / University Policies

#### Academic Integrity
Any verifiable academic misconduct results in:
1. Automatic failing grade for the class
2. Report to the Dean of Students
Includes cheating, plagiarism, collusion, falsification, unauthorized AI/tool use, IP violations. Cite all borrowed ideas.

#### Creating a Supportive Campus
Weber State values all individuals across identity and background. Maintain inclusive, respectful interaction.

#### Professionalism & Respect
Engage constructively. Provide critique on code, not people.

#### Core Beliefs
Per PPM 6-22: If course content conflicts with core beliefs, resolve before withdrawal deadline or submit written request (copy department chair). See student petition & grievance processes.

#### Harassment, Discrimination & Sexual Misconduct
Report concerns to Office of Equal Opportunity (801-626-7537) or https://weber.edu/equal-opportunity.

#### Americans with Disabilities Act
For accommodations contact [Disability Services](https://www.weber.edu/disabilityservices/default.html). Early notice improves support.

#### FERPA Rights
You may:
1. Inspect/review educational records.
2. Seek amendment of inaccurate records.
3. Consent to disclosure of personally identifiable info (with FERPA exceptions).
Directory information may include: name, major, address, phone, dates of attendance, degree(s), honors, enrollment status, and instructional videos unless you request suppression. Details: https://www.weber.edu/registrar/FERPA.html

#### Student Responsibilities
Follow standards in PPM 6-22 academically and professionally, on and off campus when representing WSU.

#### Threatening Behaviors
Not tolerated (yelling, intimidation, bullying, hostile communication). Report incidents to Dean of Students.

#### Recording Policy
Recording lectures is prohibited unless explicit permission is granted (PPM 6-22.6.6). Approved recordings are for enrolled students only and may not be redistributed.

#### Extended Campus Closure / Continuity
Instruction continues online via Canvas & Zoom. Monitor Canvas announcements and email for adjustments to due dates or assessment formats.

#### Withdrawal / Drop
You are responsible for initiating withdrawal within university deadlines. Non-attendance does not constitute withdrawal.

### Schedule (Subject to Adjustment)
